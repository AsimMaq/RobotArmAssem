Assembly of Robot Arm:
Using SolidWorks, insert meshes as solid body from the option, you'll notice that they're imported shapes.
starting with the base: define the diameter of the base by a construction geometry to mate base with other elements later
afterwards, open "wrist" and define the diameter of its base and the middle circle by the same way
then, define the big circle of "arm 01" from both ends. do so on "arm 02".
finally, define the big circle in the "gripper".
After that: mate the "base" and the "wrist" by concentric both diameters and distance mate of 0mm.
Mate "arm 01" with "wrist" by concentric one of the end with the defined circle in the "wrist" and and distance mate of 0mm.
Mate "arm 01" with "arm 02" by concentric the circular end of "arm 02" with "arm 01" and distance mate of 0mm.
mate "arm 02" with "gripper" by concenrating the other end of the arm with circle of the "gripper".
